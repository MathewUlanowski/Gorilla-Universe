# Gorilla Universe

this project is a homage to a quote from Joe Armstrong that made me laugh a bit. 

"The problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle." -- Joe Armstrong -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#Criticism

I have made a small universe and generated some gorillas across the universe this is by no means a real simulation but sort of a joke and a way to teach someone about Classes, Objects, and Properies in OOP in a firely comical way. instead of giving you a gorilla with a bannana and a whole forest here is a whole universe with galaxies, starsystems, planets, contienents, gorillas and banannas. I hope you wanted everything because now you have everything damn it.
